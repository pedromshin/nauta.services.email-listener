# Roadmap: nauta.services.email-listener

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.0 — MVP** (Phases 1–11) — inbound email → parse → extract → entities/knowledge (shipped; phase dirs retained under `.planning/phases/`, lifecycle not formally run).
- ✅ **v1.1 — Generative UI Engine** (Phases 12–15) — spec-first Catalog→Spec→Registry→Renderer→Generation→Cache→Studio. Archived: [milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md).
- ✅ **v1.2 — Generative UI: Realism & Interactivity** (Phases 16–20) — SHIPPED 2026-07-03. Eval harness + style packs + catalog expansion + declarative form engine + jailed-eval code-island (multi-candidate + judge). Archived: [milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md) · Audit: [milestones/v1.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md](milestones/v1.2-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md).
- ✅ **v1.3 — Conversational GenUI: Chat, Canvas & Dual-Channel** (Phases 22–25) — SHIPPED 2026-07-06. Persistent streamed `/chat` on a 2D infinite canvas of genui panels with bidirectional (agent↔user) interactive widgets, plus an anticipatory-prompting spike. Local/sandbox only. Archived: [milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md](milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md) · Audit: [milestones/v1.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md](milestones/v1.3-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md).

## Phases

**Phase Numbering:**
- Phase numbering continues across milestones (never restarts). v1.2 formally ended at Phase 20 (an
  informal Phase 21 quality-verification effort is recorded in STATE.md history but was never a
  numbered roadmap phase). **v1.3 starts at Phase 22.**
- Integer phases (22, 23, 24, 25): planned v1.3 milestone work.
- Decimal phases (e.g. 22.1): urgent insertions via `/gsd:phase insert`, executed between the
  surrounding integers.

## Backlog

- **999.1 — GenUI history per-importer authorization** (from Phase 16 code review, CR-01): `GET /v1/genui/history` returns all importers' rows when `importer_id` is omitted. Accepted for the current single-shared-key local/sandbox posture (auth enforced via `X-API-Key`; mirrors `/v1/genui/generate`). Enforce per-importer scoping (require `importer_id` or derive from auth context) if real multi-tenancy is introduced. Source: `.planning/phases/16-.../16-REVIEW.md`.
- **999.2 — Grid `colSpan` for asymmetric layouts** (from Phase 17 visual UAT, layout robustness): the `grid` primitive renders equal columns only — no per-child column spanning, so the model cannot express main+sidebar / asymmetric layouts (e.g. a 3/9 split). Phase 17 shipped the high-confidence clamp (`cols`→child-count, commit `75ca1b4`) + generator guidance, which fixes the common collapse; full `colSpan` support (per-node layout hint in the spec schema + interpreter wrapping each grid child in `grid-column: span N`) remains open. Also fold in the cross-file pytest event-loop test-isolation cleanup (migrate `get_event_loop().run_until_complete()` → `asyncio.run`/`pytest-asyncio`).
- **999.3 — v1.3 connected-env verification + measurement:** run the Phase-16 eval harness vs baseline on the v1.2 corpus (DEF-17-05-01/18-03-01/19-01/20-01), execute the Playwright code-island isolation spec (both engines), and add live-progress streaming to the studio (remove the silent spinner). Needs live Bedrock. (STREAM-01/02 in Phase 22 subsumes the studio live-progress-streaming item as part of the chat spine's streaming transport.)
- **999.4 — v1.4 Design Engine (deferred):** DSGN-01..04 (unify-vs-hybrid design-engine lock, rendered-visual-compare repair step, promptable design system, screenshot/URL→design-token extraction). See REQUIREMENTS.md → Future Requirements.
- **999.5 — v1.5 Orchestration Visualizer (deferred):** ORCH-01 (live orchestration run-tree visualization on the canvas). Seams left open by v1.3 (SEAM-03/04, CANVAS-03). See REQUIREMENTS.md → Future Requirements.
- **999.6 — Chat & Studio Design Uplift (deferred, queued after v1.3):** UPLIFT-01..03 — a no-bloat visual/token-discipline polish pass on `/chat` + `/studio`'s own hand-built chrome (distinct from DSGN-01..04, which is about the *generative* engine's output quality). Full code-level audit + 5 external-resource verdicts (impeccable.style adopt-now, Magic UI adopt-now-narrow, agent design skills adopt-now-narrow, styles.refero.design adopt-later-reference-only, Tailark skip) + a 3-phase punch list (zero-dep fixes → adopted external picks → design-token upgrades) already researched and written up — see `.planning/research/CHAT-STUDIO-DESIGN-UPLIFT.md`. **Explicitly sequenced to start only once v1.3 (Phases 24–25) fully ships** — user directive, not a technical dependency. Non-interference note: does not touch `GenuiPartBoundary`/`InteractiveWidgetBoundary`, already owned by Phase 24 (`24-03-PLAN.md`). When ready, run `/gsd:new-milestone` (or `/gsd:add-phase` if folded into a later milestone) pointing at the research doc — no re-research needed, it's pre-baked as a locked-decisions CONTEXT equivalent.
